# Agent Skills

Central repository for organizing reusable agent skills by category.

## Overview

This repository is a structured skill pool for agent workflows. Skills are grouped into high-level categories, and each category contains one or more skill directories with the files needed for that skill.

The goal is to keep skill discovery simple, make maintenance predictable, and provide a consistent place to add new capabilities over time.

## Repository Structure

```text
Agent-Skills/
|-- coding/
|   `-- <skill-name>/
|       |-- SKILL.md
|       |-- scripts/

```

## Categories

- `coding`: Skills related to software development, debugging, refactoring, testing, code generation, and architecture work.
- `research`: Skills focused on analysis, investigation, synthesis, and structured information gathering.
- `search`: Skills for fast lookup, retrieval, navigation, and targeted discovery tasks.
- `visualizations`: Skills for charts, diagrams, dashboards, slide assets, and visual content generation.
- `game-dev`: Skills for gameplay systems, engines, assets, tooling, and game production workflows.
- `productivity`: Skills for task management, documentation workflows, planning, and personal or team efficiency.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Choose the most appropriate category at the repository root.
2. Create a new directory using a clear, lowercase skill name such as `api-docs` or `bug-triage`.
3. Add a `SKILL.md` file that explains the skill's purpose, workflow, and usage rules.
4. Add supporting files only when needed, such as scripts, templates, reference docs, or assets.

## Suggested Skill Layout

```text
<skill-name>/
|-- SKILL.md
|-- scripts/
|-- templates/
|-- references/
`-- assets/
```

Use only the folders that are relevant for the skill. Keep each skill self-contained and focused on one job.

## Contributing

Keep naming consistent, prefer concise instructions, and avoid duplicating existing skills. If a new skill overlaps with an existing one, extend the current skill instead of creating a parallel version unless the workflow is genuinely different.
